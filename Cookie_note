=>Instead of using cookie it is better to use session in django with django-session framework 
                                                                    -----------------
=>small data send by web server(Application/cookie) to client browser.
=>when i visit next time and send request then server knows that I have already visited that sites
=>Cookie is use  to store information like cart,product,font,color and many details  added by client on browser
