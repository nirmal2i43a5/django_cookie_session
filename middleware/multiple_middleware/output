------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class fatherMiddleware:
    def __init__(self,get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response
        print("One Time father initialization")
        
    def __call__(self,request):
        print("This is father before view")
        response = HttpResponse("THis msg in the browser") 
        # You see this in the browser instead of given message in the view blc it does not go to the view instead return response from middleware
        print("THis is father after view")
        return response
