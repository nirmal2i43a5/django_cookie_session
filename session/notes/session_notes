=>This framework permits you to store and retrieve  based on user visit.
=>In cookie,data in store in client machine but using session data is not stored in user machine
=>U need to make table for using session
=>cookie is store in client which does not data but it contains session id

How you can store session ?
1 ) django.contrib.session in install apps
2 )store session in database  ==> python3 manage.py migrate but u dont need to use db just for using cookies
3 )file based session = >

SESSION_ENGINE = {
    "django.contrib.sessions.backends.file"
}

You can also set path for file for storing session id 
------------------------------------------------------
SESSION_FILE_PATH (which defaults to output from tempfile.gettempdir())

4 ) cookie based session :
The session data will be stored using django tools for cryptographic signing and secret key

SESSION_ENGINE = {
    "django.contrib.sessions.backends.signed_cookies"
}

5 ) cache based session :
For better performance you want to use cache based session.To store session data using
django cache system you need to configire cache your cache
